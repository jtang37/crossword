%% This script is meant to automatically create a crossword puzzle in an mxn grid

%{
Inputs: 
- grid size, 
- max # black squares, 
- word bank

Key rules of xword:
- no entry shorter than 3 letters
- theme entries must be longer than other entries
- no repeated words (including words within phrases)
- words must go down and across directions
- no isolated areas
- black squares are symmetrical rotationally

Optional rules
- include all letters of the alphabet
- 30 black squares maximum
- minimum 3 letter words
- avoid regions connected via only one word
- don't cross two "weird" words

1. create grid
2. populate grid with black squares
3. define each word and word crossings
4. fill grid with words


Word bank:
each word: length, frequency used, word score (high score is with weird
letters. divide by word length)


Generate a grid using a word bank:
- create algorithm to walk through picking words
